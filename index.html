<h2>What Exactly Is Incontinence – and How Common Is It?</h2>
<p>Incontinence means the unintentional loss of urine. It affects people of all ages, though it’s more common among older adults. Urinary incontinence can occur due to weakened pelvic floor muscles, childbirth, surgery, or chronic conditions such as diabetes or neurological diseases. It is a widespread condition -- and nothing to be ashamed of. Millions live with it. Many don’t talk about it. You are not alone.</p>
